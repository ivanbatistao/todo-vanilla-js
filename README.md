# ToDo App - Vanilla JS

This project brings together all the concepts and tools learned in the Frontend II course at [Digital House](https://www.digitalhouse.com/co/)

It is about a classic but an effective ToDo App in which we can add tasks we are going to be working on but also edit and delete those tasks.

We have a frontend that connects to an API which is ready to act as our backend. This way we will have data persistence in a Database set up by Digital House.
